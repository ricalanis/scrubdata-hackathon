# ScrubData — hands-off data cleaning, with the receipts

Entry for the **Build Small Hackathon** (Gradio · Hugging Face), 🏡 Backyard AI track.

> **Drop a messy export. Get clean data back — every change named, reversible, and
> explained. Anything sensitive is protected locally. The judgment calls stay yours.**
>
> For the office/ops person trying to do their job while their data is a mess.

**Live Space:** https://huggingface.co/spaces/build-small-hackathon/scrubdata

## How it works

A small local model is the **planner**, never a row-by-row editor:

1. **Profile** — pandas aggregates each column into a value–frequency distribution
   (scale-invariant: a million rows profile like a hundred).
2. **Plan** — the model reads the profile and emits a structured JSON cleaning plan:
   canonicalization mappings, format fixes, dedup, anomaly flags.
3. **Ground** — canonical forms are never invented: values reconcile against reference
   taxonomies (GeoNames 196k cities, ISO countries/states) with fuzzy retrieval; ambiguous
   matches **abstain** and surface for human review (calibrated: 90% precision at the
   default threshold, ≥95% at 0.91).
4. **Protect** — PII is detected locally (Luhn/IBAN checksums + a 44M OpenMed-PII
   classifier): cards/SSNs masked format-preservingly, contacts flagged, **0/360 residual
   PII** after masking in our leak test.
5. **Execute** — deterministic pandas applies the plan. No silent edits, by construction;
   every run exports an audit trail (OpenTelemetry-GenAI spans + open traces).

**Model:** `Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507` (Tiny Titan), QLoRA fine-tuned on **execution-verified**
synthetic + real-derived data (every training plan provably recovers the clean table),
runnable via llama.cpp GGUF.

## Measured (not vibes)

- **Canonicalization micro-F1 0.90** (4B fine-tune) vs **0.45** for a much larger generic
  model vs **0.13** for rules — small-specialized beats big-generic on this task.
- Real hospital typos: grounding beats frequency clustering (recall 0.257 vs 0.193,
  ~2× precision, −62% wrong changes); the fine-tune lifts real repair recall 0.00 → 0.42.
- Evaluated on a **65-dataset suite** (Raha benchmarks + seeded error injection over 20
  open-data domains) with a churn-neutral metric that can't be gamed by mass rewriting.

## Run it

```bash
uv sync
uv run server.py                                   # gr.Server + custom UI (grounded heuristic)

# fine-tuned model as planner (needs Ollama + the GGUF, see notebooks/Modelfile):
ollama pull hf.co/ricalanis/scrubdata-qwen3-4b-v6-q8:Q8_0
ollama create scrubdata-ft -f notebooks/Modelfile
SCRUBDATA_MODEL=scrubdata-ft uv run server.py      # model planner, heuristic fallback

SCRUBDATA_PII_NER=1 uv run server.py               # +44M NER for name/address columns
uv run python -m scrubdata.cli messy.csv -o clean.csv --plan plan.json
uv run pytest tests/                               # engine tests (25)
```
